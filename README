This is just a copy of the media_build I use to compile the media_tree at https://github.com/deeptho/media_build/

For installation: see
https://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/TBS_driver_installation

So:
mkdir tbs
cd tbs
git clone https://github.com/ljalves/media_build.git
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ljalves/linux_media.git -b latest ./media
cd media_build
make dir DIR=../media
make distclean
make
sudo make install

If something goes wrong it is uusually related to the kernel version. You need toboot
the kernel you want before compiling the code (I wish there was a working way to build for another
kernel but have not found one).
Not all kernels will work.

The last time I tried, I used:
5.5.7-200.fc31.x86_64
